      <h3> Alternative Uses of JavaScript </h3>
        <p>
        When most people think of using JavaScript, they think of using it inside the browser. However, what some may not know is that JavaScript can also be used outside the browser!
        <br>
        <br>
        What?! You may ask.
        <br>
        <br>
        Yes, it’s true. JavaScript can be used in places you may not have ever considered. 
        <br>

        In 2009, the JavaScript community created the “ServerJS” project to help specify the APIs needed for creating a large and compatible JavaScript library ecosystem. It was later renamed CommonJS to better reflect its goal of uniting both the browser-side and server-side JavaScript communities with common APIs. At the same time, a new JavaScript framework called Node.js was created. It takes Google’s V8 JavaScript interpreter engine and combines it with the CommonJS library APIs, which make it a complete environment for using JavaScript outside the browser. For example, Node.js is essentially a server in the back of an application that wants to access devices such as microphones or cameras. One specific way you can use Node.js is with Arduino, an open-source prototyping microcontroller platform intended for artists, designers, or really anyone looking to create interactive objects or environments. Arduino only supports code written in C, but you can access the serial port (a connector by which a device that sends data one bit at a time may be connected to a computer) by using Node.js! There is now a Node serial port library where you can send data over the old serial port protocol. However, Node is still fairly new, so there are still a few little features missing. For example, Node lacks the ability to auto-restart when a change is made to a server’s source code. However, thanks to Node, JavaScript is now a serious contender for web server projects, whereas before JavaScript was never considered for writing server software. (Jason Huggins, PragProg).

        One fun and surprising scenarios in which JavaScript is used outside the browser is for tracking the current location of the International Space Station. NASA maintains a live JSON feed that provides the current location. It returns the current latitude and longitude of the ISS, along with a timestamp and a message that says “success”. How cool is that? (Jeff, DataPlusScience).

        You can even use JavaScript outside the browser to automate Window’s Office Applications. Mike Parsons, a technical blogger, said that he scrapes data from a webpage and inserts it into native applications such as Microsoft Excel to use for data analysis. Much more accurate and quicker than doing such a thing manually! (Mike Parsons, Hacker Noon).

        In conclusion, JavaScript is much more than just a browser language. It has grown over the years to become one of the most commonly used languages in programming, which has to be due in part to the fact that it can be used in so many types of situations. While JavaScript is not a perfect programming language outside the browser, the fact that it even has the ability to be used server-side is very impressive.  What will JavaScript be able to do next?!
